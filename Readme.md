Are you studying math and always wanted to know your academical "heritage?"

The [Mathematics Genealogy Project](http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/) started a database providing currently (June 2011) about 150000 records of mathematicians, their degrees and advisors of their theses.

Since they don't provide a database dump this small tool crawls the (as statical assumed) website and offers you the possibility of visualizing the acedemic family tree of your lecturer or advisor using [http://www.graphviz.org/](GraphVIZ).
